# Getting Started

### Setting up a new Next.js project

Set up a new Next.js project by running the following command.

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest
```

💡 We will use the new Next.js 13 folder structures and app router. You can choose to use TypeScript and TailwindCSS; however, we’ll stick with JavaScript for simplicity.

I choose the following options 

```jsx
✔ Would you like to use TypeScript? … No
✔ Would you like to use ESLint? … Yes
✔ Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? … No
✔ Would you like to use `src/` directory? … Yes
✔ Would you like to use App Router? (recommended) … Yes
✔ Would you like to customize the default import alias? … No
```

Next, install the fauna npm package by running the following command in your terminal. 

```bash
npm i fauna --save
```

### Fauna database configuration

We’ll create a new Fauna database for this project. Head over to [dashboard.fauna.com](http://dashboard.fauna.com) and select create database.

Give your database a name. Select a region group for your database. In my case, I selected the US. This creates a database with 3 replicas across the US.

Fauna ensures that the data is always served from the user's nearest location for reduced latency. For instance, if a user's location is Iowa, Fauna will retrieve and and serve the data from the closest replica, which is in Ohio. In contrast, if a user requests data from California, it will serve the data from the California data center.

Select *disable* for backups for now and select *create*.

Once your database is created, create three collections called `User`, `Video` and `Permission`

You can create a collection by selection the `+` icon in the left side menu.

We need a secret key to connect to our database from the Next.js application. To create a new key navigate to the Fauna web shell and run the following code.

```jsx
Key.create({role: "server"})
```

 

![Untitled](Getting%20Started%209548dffddc4f4d5194591471673ac9cb/Untitled%204.png)

Save the generated secret. We will use this server key to connect to our database from the Next.js application. 

Head back over to your Next.js application code. Add a new environment variable called `NEXT_PUBLIC_FAUNA_KEY` to your `.env` file. Add the generated secret as a value for the environment variable.

```
// .env
NEXT_PUBLIC_FAUNA_KEY="fnAFJBauPOAASZ0PY_lQQhd1OqH-oPFAUql30MUV"
```

Next add the following code to your `page.js` file to verify you can connect to the database. 

```jsx
'use client'
import { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import { Client, fql } from "fauna";

export default function Home() {

  const client = new Client({
    secret: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FAUNA_KEY
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    client.query(fql`
      User.all()
    `).then((response) => {
      console.log('response', response.data.data)
    })
  }, []);

  return (
    <>    
      <div>
        Hello World
      </div>
    </>

  );
}
```

Since we haven’t added any documents to the User collection, the response will be empty at this point.
