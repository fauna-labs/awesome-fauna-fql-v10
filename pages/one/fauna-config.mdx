# Configure Fauna database

1. Head over to [Fauna](https://dashboard.fauna.com/) and create an account if you haven’t done so already. 
2. Next, create a new database. Give your database a name. Select the *classic region group* and select *create*.

Info:  *By default, Fauna allows you to save your data globally closer to your user. However, you can also limit your data's distribution to a specific geographic region group to comply with GDPR and data residency. Learn more about region groups [here](https://docs.fauna.com/fauna/current/learn/understanding/region_groups).*

*You also have the option to save data into privately distributed nodes with [Virtual Private Fauna.](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/11/17/2558259/0/en/Fauna-Launches-Virtual-Private-Offering-of-its-Serverless-Database-for-the-Most-Demanding-Enterprise-Applications.html)*

7. For local development create a new file called `.env` in the root of your project and add the following code. Make sure you add `.env` to your git ignore file so it doesn’t get committed.

```bash
FAUNA_SECRET=fnAExxxx
```

8. Finally, head back to Cloudflare Pages settings and add a new environment variable called FAUNA_SECRET.
