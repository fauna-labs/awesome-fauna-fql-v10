# Create a new Project

Create a new Next.js project by running the following command. 

```sh
$ npx create-next-app <your-app-name>
```

> ðŸ’¡ Info: When you create API routes in your Next.js application (i.e. under `/pages/api` folder) and deploy them to Cloudflare each of these functions become individual Cloudflare Workers function on the Edge.* 


## Configure the project to use the Edge Runtime

Next, enable edge-runtime for your API routes. Open the `pages/api/hello.js` file. This is an API route. When deployed this API route will become an edge function, however for this to work you have the add the following code. 

```jsx
// pages/api/hello.js

export const config = {
  runtime: 'experimental-edge',
}

export default async function (req) {
  return new Response(
    JSON.stringify({ name: 'John Doe' }),
    {
      status: 200,
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      }
    }
  )
}
```

To learn more about how Edge Runtime works refer to Next.js'Â [Edge API Routes documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/edge-api-routes). 

Run the following command in the root of your project to locally build your application. 

```bash
$ npx @cloudflare/next-on-pages --experimental-minify
```

You will notice the following output for a successful build.

Notice that a folder named `.vercel/output` is generated. Inside you can find the generated Clourflare Workers and Pages functions.


## Create a GitHub repository

Next, create a new GitHub repository by visiting [repo.new](https://repo.new/). When you are done creating a new repository, prepare and push your local application to GitHub by running the following commands in your terminal:

```
$ git remote add origin <YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL>
$ git branch -M main
$ git push -u origin main

```

## Deploy with Cloudflare Pages

4. In the environment variable section add a new variable called `NODE_VERSION` and add the node version of your project. **You require a node version 14 or greater.**

5. Next, go to **Settings > Functions** and under compatibility flags add the following flags.

`streams_enable_constructors`, `transformstream_enable_standard_constructor`.

*These flags are scheduled to graduate on the 2022-11-30 compatibility date and should no longer be necessary to manually add after November 30, 2022.*

1. Select Save and Deploy

Visit the deployed site url to make sure everything is working as expected.

Next, visit [`https://<your-domain-name>/api/hello`](https://with-cloudflare-nextjs.pages.dev/api/hello) to make sure that the Pages function is working as expected.
