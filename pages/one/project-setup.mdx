# Project setup

Make sure you have the serverless framework installed. You can install it by running the following command in a terminal:

```bash
$ npm i serverless -g
```

**AWS environment variables setup**

Login to your AWS account. Select programmatic access from the menu and copy the environment variables.

ðŸ’¡Â ***If you are new to AWS, follow [this guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-sec-cred-types.html) to configure your AWS credentials.***

Set the environment variables by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="ASIA......"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="iaGNguG/RYA2zFT6...."
```

You can also set up an AWS profile. AWS allows you to set up multiple profiles. Follow [this guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-profiles.html) to learn more.

## Create a new AWS Serverless project

Create a new project by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
$ serverless create --template aws-nodejs
```

Find the `serverles.yml` file in the code and add the following changes:

```yaml
service: fauna-aws-workshop

frameworkVersion: '3'

provider:
  name: aws
  runtime: nodejs14.x
  httpApi:
    cors: true

functions:
  hello:
    handler: handler.hello
    events:
      - httpApi:
          method: POST
          path: /book-vacation
```

In the code above, we are creating a simple REST API using the serverless framework infrastructure as code. 

Next, run the following command to ensure you can deploy your stack to AWS:

```bash
$ sls deploy
```

Once the deployment is complete, you get a URL for your API. Make a POST call to the endpoint to ensure everything works as expected.

### **ðŸ’¡Â Pro Tip:**

The serverless framework creates all the cloud formation files under a folder called `.serverless`. You can port this to your solution if you want to use another IoC (SAM, CDK, etc.). The workshop demo app repository includes the cloud formation files.

## Configure Fauna

Head over to [dashboard.fauna.com](http://dashboard.fauna.com/) and create a new database. 

Then select *Security > Keys > New Key* option to generate a new key.

Select Admin for the Role, give your key a name, and select *Save*.

Next, head back to the code. Add the `fauna-serverless` plugin and `dot-env` plugin to your project. Run the following command in your terminal to install these packages:

```bash
$ npm i @fauna-labs/serverless-fauna serverless-dotenv-plugin --save
```

Create a `.env` file in the root of your application and add the Fauna key and domain:

```bash
FAUNA_ROOT_KEY='fnAEsUSh...' # Your Admin Key
FAUNA_DOMAIN='db.fauna.com' # Your database's Region Group Domain
```

### Region groups in Fauna

Region Groups provide control over where your data resides in Fauna. Each database, its storage, and compute services exist in a specific geographic region. You control the region group by specifying the domain.

- Here are some options for different Region Groups and their domains in Fauna.
    
    
    | Region | Domain |
    | --- | --- |
    | USÂ regionÂ group | db.us.fauna.com |
    | EUÂ regionÂ group | db.eu.fauna.com |
    | ClassicÂ regionÂ group | db.fauna.com |

We want to create a new collection called `Vacation` and an index `vacations_by_userId` to find vacations by userId. You can do this through the serverless framework without touching any UI.
Add the following changes to your `serverless.yml` file.

```yaml highlight=5-27
service: fauna-aws-workshop

frameworkVersion: '2.72.3'

**# Specify dotenv
useDotenv: true

# Add Fauna plugin
plugins:
  - serverless-dotenv-plugin
  - fauna-labs/serverless-fauna

fauna:
  client:
    secret: ${env:FAUNA_ROOT_KEY}
    domain: ${env:FAUNA_DOMAIN}
  collections:
    Vacation: 
      name: Vacation
  indexes:
    vacations_by_userId:
      name: vacations_by_userId
      source: Vacation
      terms:
        fields:
          - data.userId**

provider:
  ... # rest of the file
```

Run the `sls deploy` command to push the changes. A new collection and an index in your Fauna database is created once the deploy script finishes running.
