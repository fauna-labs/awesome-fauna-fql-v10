### Introduction

This sample application is called `FaunaMarket`. This application is a simplified clone of **Etsy** or **Shopify**. It is a multi vendor marketplace application. When you clone the repository and start digging around, you will find a plethora of well-commented example queries for Fauna FQL. In this tutorial, we will cover all the Fauna queries in detail. However, we will not go over all the javascript application code.
